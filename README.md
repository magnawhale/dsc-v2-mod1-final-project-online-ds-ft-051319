# Module 1 Final Project

Real estate makes up an enormous portion of the economy of the United States. It should be no surprise that a house is often the most important purchase a person or family may ever make. With so much weight attached to the selling of a house, it is important that a home owner try their best to sell their house for as much as the market will bear and for home buyers to purchase a house for as little as possible. To achieve both ends simultaneously, statistical models can be very useful.

This project will utilize a year's worth of housing data from the Seattle metro area to construct a model to accurately predict the sale price of a home based on the variables present in the dataset. 

- This project utilizes the dataset called [kc_house_data.csv](kc_house_data.csv)
- You can view the whole process in [student2.ipynb](student2.ipynb)

The questions we will answer in the midst of this project are:

- How can we reduce the number of variables in our model to something manageable?
- How might we handle geographical variables?
- Do we have any linear relationships?
